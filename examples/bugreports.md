When you're filing bug reports, you should include as much detail as possible.

What was the _bug_?
What were you doing?
How were you doing it?
What were the _expected_ results?
What actually happened?

_Including as much detail as possible_ it makes it easy for the developers to replicate the bug.
Once they can reproduce the bug, they will be able to identify the cause of the bug and fix it.
