When you're filing bug reports, you should include as much detail as possible. 

What was the bug?
What were you doing?
How were you doing it?
What were the expected results?
What actually happened?

Including as much detail as possible it makes it easy for the developers to replicate the bug.
Once they can reproduce the bug, they will be able to identify the cause of the bug and fix it.
